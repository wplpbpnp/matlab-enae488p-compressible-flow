## Contents

- Homework scripts (`hw1.m` to `hw5.m`)
- Project/problem scripts (`final_project.m`, `tbm.m`, `oshock.m`, `equation.m`, `m2.m`, `p2p1.m`)
- Supporting images (`*.jpg`, `*.tif`)
- Published outputs in `html/` (`*.pdf`)

## Staging Cleanup Applied

- Removed duplicate files named `Copy_of_*`
- Removed editor autosave file (`final_project.asv`)
- Removed scratch notebook file (`test.mlx`)

## Getting Started (MATLAB)

1. Open MATLAB in the repo root.
2. Start with standalone scripts such as `oshock.m`, `tbm.m`, `equation.m`, `m2.m`, or `p2p1.m`.
3. Review matching published outputs in `html/` (for example `html/oshock.pdf` or `html/final_project.pdf`) to see expected report-style results.
4. Run `final_project.m` after the smaller scripts if you want the most complete example.

## Suggested Showcase Files

- `final_project.m`
- `oshock.m`
- `tbm.m`
- `html/final_project.pdf`
